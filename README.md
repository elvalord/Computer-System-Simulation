# Computer-System-Simulation
This project implemented a discrete event simulation of a computer system consisting of a CPU, memory and two disks. I evaluated the performance of the system with different job arrival rates. I also identified the bottleneck of the system by enhancing different components respectively and evaluating the improvement of the system. It is written in C.
